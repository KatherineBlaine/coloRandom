## Context
[//]: <>
We are all students in the 2211 FE Cohort at Turing School of Software and Design in our fourth week of Mod 1.

For this project, we were provided with an image of a potential window layout along with instructions and requirements for what the app should do. No directories or files were provided and we were tasked with building the app from the ground up, creating our own `.html`, `.css`, and `.js` files.

The project was received 1/2/2022 and the base requirements were completed by 1/4/2022 after approximately 13 hours.
